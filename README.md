My Repository for https://tubitak.gov.tr for making an online db system.

This repository has in a developing situation. So it is only for it's Back-End Node.js version. It will be updated in next months. And I will publish it's full version as https://github.com/ardakaragoz/onlinedb

```js
// Example, you have domain and your URL is xxx.com
const get = //SOMETHING TO MAKE A REQUEST MODULE OR CODE
get('xxx.com/yaz/YOUR_KEY/data1/HelloWorld')
//And it will returns as your json file like this:
{
"data1": "HelloWorld"
}
```

## In Basic, this module is for Online Database System with JSON for my school project. Good days :) !
